## For optimal transport course report

There are some notes for writing the reports:

-why do we take experimens mainly on k^2=0.04?

-add the ICNN structure png and resnet png

-The ICNN initialization problem:
If I use the ICNN's derivative to calculate the loss, the f could only be two-step. Only use ICNN to compare with the piecewise-quadratic function, we could make it.

-add the plot for segmented initilization and piecewise-quadratic

-analyze why f is more important than g for loss decreasing.

-How to add page for the report??

-add another way to represent Witsenhausen loss.

 add the footnote to say it's RAdam in table 2.
